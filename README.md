# OpenShulkerBoxes
Simple Bukkit plugin to open the inventories of Shulker Boxes without placing them down. Either via clicking in the main hand or interacting in the inventory. (Unfortunately creative mode doesn't work there)

Right click on box in inventory                             | Right click with box in hand
